# freeCodeCamp-Machine-Learning-With-Python-Solutions
A series of machine learning and deep learning models that solve the test questions posted on freeCodeCamp's course on Machine Learning with Python.
It is coded on Python 3.0 using Keras module from TensorFlow library but additional libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas and SciKit-Learn are also required.

1. Cat and Dog classifier: A computer vision project that uses a convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs.
2. Healthcare Cost Predictions: A artificial neural network aimed to perform linear regression to predict healthcare costs.
